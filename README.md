I'm a 3rd-year [Management Engineering] (https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/management-engineering) student with a specialization in Aritifical Intelligence at the University of Waterloo! I'm studying software, and data analytics, information systems, operations and supply chain management, and organizational behaviour!

⚡ I'm fascinated by how code can be used to enhance our day-to-day lives and I'm passionate about ethical technology and how innovation can be used to achieve positive results for society! I've been coding for over 5 years and I'm always excited to learn more.
